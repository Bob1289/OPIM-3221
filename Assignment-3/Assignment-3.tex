        IDK if you wanted me to divide the salary by 12 so I did both
        \includegraphics*[scale=.16]{6.2.png}
    \end{center}
    \item The HR department needs a report that displays the first name, last name, and email of all employees who were hired in 1996. Label the columns F Name, L Name, and Email, respectively.

        I didn't have much luck using the concatenation operator to combine the first and last name so I just used CONCAT
