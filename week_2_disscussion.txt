Throughout the world, vacation cruises on increasingly larger ships have been steadily growing in popularity. People like the all-inclusive price for food, room, and entertainment, the variety of shipboard activities, and the ability to unpack just once and still visit several places on their vacation.

Happy Cruise Lines has several ships and operates (begins its cruises) from a number of ports. It has a variety of vacation cruise itineraries, each involving several ports-of-call. The company wants to keep track of both its past and future cruises and the past passengers who sailed on past cruises and are booked on future cruises.

Actually you can think of a cruise line as simply a somewhat specialized case of any passenger transportation company, including airlines, trains, and buses. Beyond that, a cruise line is, after all, a business, and like any other business of any kind it must be concerned about finances, employees, equipment, and so forth

Using the introductory description of (and hints about) Happy Cruise Lines in Minicase #1 spend 5 minutes making a bulleted list of the things in Happy Cruise Lines' business environment about which you think the company would want to maintain data. 

Once you have the list created underline the pieces of data you believe  that qualify as corporate resources? Remember a piece of data is a corporate resource if it can create a competitive advantage. 

We've just begun to talk about data, but even at this early state develop some ideas of how the data you underlined in Part b can be used by Happy Cruise Lines to gain a competitive advantage over other cruise lines. Choose one and write a few sentences explaining why.

-	Cruise ship ID
-	Cruise ship itinerary
-	Passenger ID
-	Log of cruise attendance
-	Passenger reviews
-	Cost of cruise
-	Cost of maintenance and day to day expenses
-	Passenger demographics

An important piece of data that can be used to gain a competitive advantage over other cruise lines would be the passengers ID. This can be helpful as it would help us infer many other pieces of data from if they attended a cruise and track what types of cruises they would like. Happy Cruise Lines can then group up these people to curate a more enticing cruise for them and in turn profit more.
